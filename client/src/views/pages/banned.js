          <p>
            If you have been directed to this page then it likely means that you are listed on and
            potentially banned by the Squad Community Ban List.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Squad Community Ban List is dedicated to helping create a healthy Squad community
            that everyone can enjoy, including players that were previously harmful to the community
            and have since reformed. Therefore, we are keen to assist players in being able to
            access the Squad community without the Squad Community Ban List limiting where they can
            and cannot play. However, there are limits in what we can do to assist these players due
            to our strict operating procedures.

            The information provided on the following pages will give you more information on the

          <h6>Introduction</h6>
          <p>
            The Squad Community Ban List is a community-led project that aims to protect the Squad
            community's integrity through collaboration and information sharing. It is{' '}
            <strong>not</strong> affiliated with Offworld Industries, the creators of Squad, and
            they have little to no influence in regards to how the Squad Community Ban List is
            operated.
          </p>
          <h6>How Does It Work?</h6>
          <p>
            The Squad Community Ban List works with a number of "partner organisations", who are
            Squad communities licensed to operate Squad servers by Offworld Industries, who provide
            us with access to their ban lists. At regular intervals, our fully automated system
            downloads a copy of the bans on their ban lists and stores them in our database. We then
            provide others with access to the data in our database via this website, Discord bots
            and other channels.
          </p>
          <h6>Only Facts!</h6>
          <p>
            The Squad Community Ban List only shares facts regarding players based on the bans we
            import from our partner organisations' ban lists and we do not make or share opinions
            based on the bans we import. Therefore, we will always share the bans we import to our
            users regardless of whether we think the ban is or isn't valid and will only ever remove
            players/bans we share when our partner organisations remove them from their ban lists.
            As a result, there is not much we can do to assist players who are listed or who have
            been banned by our system.

          <h3 className="text-center">Getting unlisted from the Squad Community Ban List</h3>
          <p>
            If a player has been listed on the Squad Community Ban List's website, it does not necessarily mean that
            they have been banned by the Squad Community Ban List. It only means that we have imported a ban against
            them from one of our partner organisations.
          </p>
          <p>
            As previously mentioned, the Squad Community Ban List only shares facts regarding
            players based on the bans we import from our partner organisations' ban lists and will
            only ever remove players/bans we share when our partner organisations remove them from
            their ban lists. Therefore, to get yourself unlisted from the Squad Community Ban List
            you must politely ask the partner organisations who have banned you to delete the bans
            from your history. It is, however, unlikely that they will delete the bans from your
            history but they may agree to turn some of your active bans to expired bans.

          <h3 className="text-center">Getting unbanned from the Squad Community Ban List</h3>
          <p>
            Squad servers may opt to use a Squad Community Ban List export ban list to protect their
            community. If you have been kicked from a server with a reason relating to the Squad
            Community Ban List then it means that you have probably met the criteria to be listed on
            one of these export ban lists. Below we will explain these criteria and explain how you
            can attempt to get removed from our export ban lists.
          </p>
          <h6>Criteria System</h6>
          <p>
            Our criteria system uses a point based system that each Squad server can configure when
            creating an export ban list. Bans listed on our website will contribute a number of
            points which can be configured to be different depending on whether they were are active
            or expired, their age and who's ban list they belong to. Once the total number of points
            a player has exceeds the configurable threshold, they will be added to the export ban list
            and banned from the server as a result.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider the following example using our default points. Bob has 2 active bans that
            contribute 3 points each and 4 expired bans that contribute 1 point each. This makes his
            total number of points 10 which exceeds the default threshold of 9 and therefore Bob
            will be added to the export ban list.
          </p>
          <h6>Getting Unbanned from the Squad Community Ban List</h6>
          <p>
            There are a number of different ways of getting unbanned from the Squad Community Ban
            List:
          </p>
          <ul className="font-weight-light">
            <li>
              Appeal the bans listed on our website so that you no longer meet the criteria of our
              export ban lists.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ask the server you wish to play on to make an exception for you. Some servers have the
              ability to do this if they are importing one of our export ban lists via an admin tool known as
              Battlemetrics.
            </li>
            <li>
              Play on another server. Only a small number of Squad servers use the Squad Community
              Ban List and therefore there should be a wide range of others servers that you can
              play on.
            </li>
